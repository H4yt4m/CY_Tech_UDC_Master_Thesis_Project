# Image Processing Using Quantum Annealing

This repository contains my final master thesis' project for my double degree High Performance Data Analytics & High Performance Computing @ CY Tech Engineering Graduate School & University of A Coruña.

It was an opportunity for me to learn about the world of Hyperspectral imaging as well as Quantum Computing.

- Goal :

  - Hyperspectral Image Segmentation using Quantum Annealing.

- Key concepts :

  - Hyperspectral Imaging
  - Markov Random Fields
  - Ising Model
  - Quantum Annealing
  - D-Wave SDK

- Under the guidance of :

  - 𝐆𝐚𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐨 :

    - Head of Simulation and Data Lab @ Jülich Supercomputing Centre
    - Adjunct Associate Professor @ University of Iceland.

  - 𝐏𝐢𝐨𝐭𝐫 𝐆𝐚𝐰𝐫𝐨𝐧 :

    - Scientific Computing & Information Technology Group Leader @ AstroCeNT: Particle Astrophysics Science and Technology Centre, International Research Agenda, Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Centre.

🚩 : Some of my projects intentionally remain without updates to serve as a record of my ongoing development and learning journey. 😁
