# Image Processing Using Quantum Annealing
This is my master thesis' project. The main goal is to create an algorithm for image processing (classification, segmentation, etc), through the implementation of the Ising model, adapted for quantum annealing.

The experiment will be done on Advantage System JUPSI, an annealing quantum computer from D-Wave, hosted at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. 

How to setup Dendron for notes management : 

    - Install the Dendron extension from VS Codium's extension store.

    - Clone this repository.
    
    - Open the folder containing this project into VS Codium.
    
    - Open Dendron's view by clicking on the related extension in the left side panel (If the icon is not appearent, ensure that Dendron is enabled in the current workspace from the extension's store).
    
    - In the top right hand side of the left column of Dendron's view, select the three dots and disable "Tip of the day" and "Help and Feedback".   
    
    - An overview of all my notes are in the "Tree view" drawer, on the left column of Dendron's view.
