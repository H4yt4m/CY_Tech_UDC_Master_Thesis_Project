- In the slides : "Calculate probabilities Pi (c), Pi (Â¬c) of i-th pixel from X having / not having class c."
Does that mean that I should to index the image and the lattice as 1D array instead of 2D (using the superindex k = imageWidth * i + j), in order that each pixel of superindex i is coupled with a spin of the same superindex i ? 

- Sources to get a hyperspectral image with its ground truth ? 

I only was able to find MATLAB compatible files:  https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes

Should i use them with scipy https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.io.loadmat.html ?

- Plan of the following three weeks ? (full time thesis...)
