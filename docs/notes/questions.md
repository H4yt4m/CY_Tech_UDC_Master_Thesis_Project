- Can I use an open source implementation of the ising model to embed it to a chimera graph for the Quantum annealing later on ? Or is it better to implement a version from scratch ?
    - Open source versions I found : 
        - https://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/ising-model/ (checking rn)
        - https://github.com/MohamedElashri/IsingModel/blob/main/Python/Ising.ipynb
        - https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/blob/main/Python%20Metaphysics%20Series/vid14.ipynb
        
    - Ising and metropolis : 
        - https://phas.ubc.ca/~rozali/8.pdf

        
- Will we compare the results of our "future" algorithm with an open source parallel and/or GPU optimized implementation ?

- Can I use open source packages ? SVM from scikit-learn, OpenCV, ...
