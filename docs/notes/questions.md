- ising_model.py : 
    - Issue with Cesga's FinisTerrae3 : could not run the visualization for the lattice... Try to change from matplotlib for high performance visualization like vispy ? or just store each lattice in every step in a numpy array and export it without visualization ?
    - In the code : # To verify
    - For 2.9 (function get_pixel_ising_proba): 
        - How are local energies defined for the hamiltonian ? like in 2.4 ?
    - Which D-Wave function for chimera embedding ?

- Should I try to implement the one vs one version as well ?
