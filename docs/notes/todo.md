# Advises :

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.
- Marp for slides.
- Create a story around the presentation and thesis document

# Tasks :

  - Search for another hyperspectral image : Remote sensing, Healthcate, James webb ?
  - Implement my own embedding algorithm
  - remove lattice items on hamiltonian...
  - Finish the remaining parts of the algorithm in the slides


# Later : 

  - BQM vs CQM...
  - Separate Generation and simulation in SEPARATE FILES
  - Continue reading about QSVM (Gabriele's paper, lecture and QSVM notebooks)
  - View Piotr's Slides from summer school in iceland...
  - Make a visualization of the whole workflow of the algorithm with details about every function.
  - Search for other hyperspectral images
  - Comparing the results of our "future" algorithm to existing parallel and/or GPU optimized implementations ?
