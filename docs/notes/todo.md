# Advises :

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.
- Create a story around the presentation and thesis document
- 1 min per slide !!!!!!!

# Tasks :

- Add an abstract
- Add visual graphs to ising
- Networkx graph (and in dwave...)
- Finish the remaining parts of the algorithm in the slides

# Later :

- Add compressive sensing
- Search for another hyperspectral image (Healthcate, James webb, etc) ?
- Remove all useless imports in python files : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2540202/how-can-i-check-for-unused-import-in-many-python-files 
- Fix references 
- BQM vs CQM...
- Separate Generation and simulation in SEPARATE FILES
- View Piotr's Slides from summer school in iceland...
- Make a visualization of the whole workflow of the algorithm with details about every function.
- Search for other hyperspectral images
- Comparing the results of our "future" algorithm to existing parallel and/or GPU optimized implementations ?
- Continue reading about QSVM (Gabriele's paper, lecture and QSVM notebooks)
