### Tasks :

- Compare the results of our "future" algorithm with an open source parallel and/or GPU optimized implementation.
- Find a hyperspectral image with pixel classes defined (indian pines)...
- Make a basic svm for the image segmentation
- Start with just two classes...
- The goal is to have a visualization...
- I can use the indian pines hyperscale images...
- Look for cross validation...
- Quantum SVM ...
- Whole pipeline...
- Hyperparam (svm, qsvm?)...
- Deep understanding of the main algorithm...
- Mermaid markdown flowcharts
- One-shot learning for the SVM...

### Advises : 

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
