# Advises :

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.

# Tasks :

### Coding
  - Finish the remaining parts of the algorithm in the slides (Chimera etc)
  - See Gabriele's new paper on overfitting in mail.
  - Understand Quantum SVM : (Gabriele's paper, lecture and QSVM notebooks)

### Thesis
  - Start writing thesis and slides
  - Make a visualization of the whole workflow of the algorithm with details about every function.

# Later : 
  - Adapt parameters in FinisTerrae script job.sh
  - Seach for other hyperspectral images
  - Comparing the results of our "future" algorithm to existing parallel and/or GPU optimized implementations ?
