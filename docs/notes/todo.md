### Advises : 

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.

### Tasks :

- Is Gibbs sampling useful ?
- Deep understanding of the main algorithm...
- Make a basic SVM for the image segmentation :
    - Start with just two classes
    - Look for cross validation
    - Whole pipeline
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - One-shot learning
- The goal is to have a visualization...
- Understand Quantum SVM with hyperparameter tuning...
- Does it make sense to compare the results of our "future" algorithm to an open source parallel and/or GPU optimized implementation ?
