### Advises :

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.

### Tasks :

- Refactor and optimize the SVM and Ising codes.
- Understand Quantum SVM :
  - Gabriele's paper...
  - Gabriele's lectures and qsvm notebook...
  - Hyperparameter tuning ?
- Later : Comparing the results of our "future" algorithm to existing parallel and/or GPU optimized implementations ?
