### Advises : 

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.

### Tasks :

- Study and add to references : https://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/CMSC733/MarkovModelsMRFs.pdf

- Make a basic SVM for the image segmentation :
    - Whole pipeline in sklearn
    - One-shot learning (?)
    - Save img in jpg format
    - Test it in cesga's FT3

- The goal is to have a visualization...
- Finish the ising model...
- Deep understanding of the main algorithm...
- Understand Quantum SVM with hyperparameter tuning...
- Does it make sense to compare the results of our "future" algorithm to an open source parallel and/or GPU optimized implementation ?
