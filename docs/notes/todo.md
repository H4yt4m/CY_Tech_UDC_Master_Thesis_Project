### Advises : 

- Write the reference for the mathematical equations used.
- Write the reference for the code parts that inspired me.
- Avoid explicitly global variables.
- Add visualizations and flow diagrams for functions.
- Remember the triangle : Mathematics, Code, Visualization.
- Mermaid markdown for flowcharts.

### Tasks :

- Refactor and optimize the SVM and Ising codes.
- Test with sbatch jobs on cesga's FT3.
- Understand Quantum SVM :
    - Gabriele's paper...
    - Gabriele's lectures and qsvm notebooks...
    - Hyperparameter tuning
- Later think about comparing the results of our "future" algorithm to existing parallel and/or GPU optimized implementations ?
