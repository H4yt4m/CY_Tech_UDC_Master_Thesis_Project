- Type of Hopfield Network.
- Main differences :
    - Neurons' activation at each step is determined partially randomly ⇾ *Stochastic* Neural Network.
    - Input and single hidden layer (thus not all neurons are of the same type).
    - Neurons of the same type are NOT connected to each other (links only between different types) ⇾ restricted...
- Logistic activation rule (state update of each unit...)
- Contrastive divergence (Learning weights...)
