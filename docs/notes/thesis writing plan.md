EACH POINT IS ONE SLIDE, COULD BE DIVIDED IN THE PRESENTATION INTO MULTIPLE STEPS

INSTITUTIONS LOGO UNDER EACH PAGE

- Title and me
- Supervisors
- Goal of the project : Analysis of hyperspectral images (satellites, healthcare, etc) : Before and after (target)
- SVM : General Presentation
- Maths behind the SVM
- Ising model : Presentation, use cases
- Relation of Ising to MRF and RBM
- Overall algorithm : Initial part of the SVM
- Overall algorithm : Second part of the Ising
- Overall algorithm : Final part of embedding and restitution
- HPC characteristics (FT3 as example)
- QC : Physics theory behind it
- QC : Gate based (briefly) vs QA Differences (JSC's D-WAVE QA as example)
- Code details : SVM (No optimization to see clear improvement, etc)
- Code details : Issues with high performance visualization of Ising
- Code details : Solution with numba as a JIT compiler + advantages
- Code details : Embedding to D-Wave QA and restitution
- Results
- Benchmarks with vs without numba on a small lattice with random elements generated
- Highlights my competences from this double degree in terms of AI HPC QC
- Thanks !
