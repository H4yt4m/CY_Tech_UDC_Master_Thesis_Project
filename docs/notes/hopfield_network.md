- Neural network.
- Same type of neurons (no input, hidden and output...).
- Each neuron with binary value : -1 or +1.
- Every neuron is linked to ALL other neurons.
- Each link has a weight between -1 and +1.
- Hebbian learning : Slightly increase the link's weight if both neurons have the same value in a training data set. Else slightly decrease it. 
- Goal : For every input, adjust the output from the training data that resembles the most to the input. 
- Convergence technique : Minimum Energy State.
